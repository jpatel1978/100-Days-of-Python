# Debugging

## Instructions

Look at the code in main.py 

There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.

*Warning* : The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.

## Example Output

When you run your program, it should print the following:

`Day 1 - Lecture 1.6 - String Manuplation & Indentation`

`String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign. Intdentation is most important in Python!`

`Example: print("Hello " + "world")`

`New lines can be created with a backslash and n.`

All The Best! 🤜
